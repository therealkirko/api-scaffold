## About Laravel API Scaffold

This is a Laravel API Scaffold project with sanctum. 
[Laravel Sanctum](https://github.com/laravel/sanctum) provides a featherweight authentication system for SPAs (single page applications), mobile applications, and simple, token based APIs. Sanctum allows each user of your application to generate multiple API tokens for their account. These tokens may be granted abilities / scopes which specify which actions the tokens are allowed to perform.

Feel free to fork the project, manipulate or change it to suit your own custom needs. In future I will be adding more features



### Active Plugins
